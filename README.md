# Speech_Recognition

Understanding the implementation of speech recognition:

 This Python code implements a simple voice assistant that uses speech
 recognition to listen for voice commands and responds by playing a song
 on YouTube using the `pywhatkit` library. Here's a breakdown of the
 code:
 
 1. The code imports necessary libraries for speech recognition
 (`speech_recognition`), text-to-speech conversion (`pyttsx3`), and
 interacting with YouTube (`pywhatkit`).

 2. It defines a `speak` function that converts text to speech using the
 `pyttsx3` library.

 3. It defines a `hear` function that listens for voice commands using the
 microphone and Google's speech recognition service. It returns the
 recognized command as text.

 4. The main function `run` listens for a command using the `hear`
 function, processes the received command, plays the requested song on
 YouTube using `pywhatkit`, and announces it with text-to-speech using
 the `speak` function.

 5. The program then runs the main `run` function to start the voice
 assistant.

 Overall, this code demonstrates a basic voice assistant that can
 understand voice commands, play songs on YouTube, and provide audio
 feedback to the user
